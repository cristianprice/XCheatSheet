# CMake

CMake is a tool to generate build scripts. 
In a mouthful way: it builds build scripts.
The original purpose of CMake is to be platform independent.
For example, the same CMake file can generate scripts for GNU make, clang and MSVC.

There is a growing population of IDEs supporting CMake.
E.g., KDevelop and CLion.

Basically, there should be a `CMakeLists.txt` file (don't miss the **s** in the file name) 
in your project's root directory.
There should also be a `CMakeLists.txt` file in every sub-directory 
that contains source files to be compiled
(either into object files or executables).

## Root CMake file and sub-directory CMake file

`project_root/CMakeLists.txt`
---
```cmake
# Put this file in the root directory of your project
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8 FATAL_ERROR)

### Generating build script

Out-of-source building are usually used with CMake. 
That is, we create a separate fold named build/release/debug/etc. 
and put all built files in it.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..  # this will generate a set of folders and a build script (e.g., makefile)
make      # build
# Alternatives:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug ..
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=relase -Dtest=OFF ..
VERBOSE=1 make
```

`project_root/src/CMakeLists.txt`
---
The `src` directory contains a bunch of **class definitions**.
I compile these classes into object files and group them as a (static) library.

```cmake
# foo_src is a list of *.cpp files in the this directory
file(GLOB foo_src RELATIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} "*.cpp")
# CMake will compile them into a library libfoo.a
add_library(foo STATIC ${foo_src})
```

`project_root/experiment/CMakeLists.txt`
---
The `experiment` directory contains a set of experiment programs.
Each \*.cpp file contains a `main` function and each file is compiled into an **executable**.

```cmake
# My experiments need to use another library called pcm
# In this example, pcm is obtained as a pre-compiled library (*.a)
include_directories("${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/pcm" "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}")
file(GLOB experiment_src RELATIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} "*.cpp")
# Add an executable for each *.cpp file
foreach(srcfile ${experiment_src})
    string(REPLACE ".cpp" "" exp ${srcfile})
    add_executable(${exp} ${srcfile})
#   Linking my classes definition and pcm
    target_link_libraries(${exp} foo ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/pcm/pcm-lib.a)
endforeach()
```

## Using Google Test

GoogleTest comes along with its own CMake file that builds its own library.
My approach: simply copy the whole GoogleTest folder into your project directory,
then make it a sub-directory of your project.

Notice the line `add_subdirectory(gtest-1.7.0)` in the root CMake file above.

`project_root/test/CMakeLists.txt`
---
The `test` folder contains a set of test cases that uses the GoogleTest framework.

```cmake
# Remember to include the GoogleTest's headers
# the variables like gtest_SOURCE_DIR are defined by gtest's CMake file
include_directories(${gtest_SOURCE_DIR}/include ${gtest_SOURCE_DIR})
file(GLOB test_src RELATIVE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} "*.cpp")
# Remember to link the gtest libray.
# Also gtest_main, if you don't have your own main function. (Yep I'm lazy)
add_executable(all-test ${test_src})
target_link_libraries(all-test byteslice-core gtest gtest_main)
# autoplay: run the all-test executable immediately after it is built.
# Note: currently CMake's add_custome_command(TARGET ...) function only supports
# targets defined in the same directory,
# which I think is a weakness.
if(autoplay)
message(STATUS "Autoplay tests after build.")
add_custom_command(TARGET all-test
                   POST_BUILD
                   COMMAND all-test
                   WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}
                   COMMENT "Running all test case using google-test.")
endif()
```
