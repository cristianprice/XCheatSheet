XCheatSheet
=========

I do research in main memory data processing systems.
I mostly write C++ under Linux environments.

This repo contains a bunch of files I use as my own handy cheatsheet.
By no means they are intended to be tutorials or manuals.
There is no warranty for the correctness of these files.
But I will be glad if you find them helpful.

Also, you are welcome to tell me if you :
+ find a bug in the files;
+ think I do something in a typically wrong way;
+ would like to suggest a better approach for some issue.

I will be grateful for such opinions and suggestions.
