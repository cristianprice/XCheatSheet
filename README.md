XCheatSheet
=========

I write C++ codes under Linux environments.
I am fond of the GNU toolchain.
I do research mainly in database systems.

This repo contains a group of files I use as my handy cheatsheet.
By no means they are intended to be tutorials or manuals.
There is no warranty for the correctness of these files.
But I will be glad if you find them helpful.
