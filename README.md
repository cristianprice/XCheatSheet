XCheatSheet
=========

I do research in main memory data processing systems.
I mostly write C++ under Linux environments.

The purpose of this repo is nothing more than a personal handy cheatsheet.
By no means it is intended to be tutorials or manuals.
There is no warranty for the correctness of these files.
But I will be glad if you find them helpful.

Also, you are welcome to tell me if you :
+ find a bug in the files;
+ think I do something in a typically wrong/flawy/inefficient way;
+ would like to suggest a better approach for some task.

I will be grateful for such opinions and suggestions.
